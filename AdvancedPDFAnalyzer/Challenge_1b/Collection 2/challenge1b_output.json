Di\ufb00erent types of sources have di\ufb00erent tools available for PDF \nconversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in \nthe Print dialog box. \nIf a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft \nExcel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is \nalready open, you don\u2019t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. \nEvery PDF balances e\ufb03ciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the \nbalance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an \nappropriate conversion method. \nFor example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat \napplies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. \nIf you want more control over the process, you\u2019ll want to use another method. \nPDF creation methods by file type \nRefer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the di\ufb00erent types of files. \nFile Type \nPDF Creation Methods \nAny file format \nMethod 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a \nfile type and then select the file that you want to convert to \nPDF. \nOr, select the hamburger menu \n (Windows) or \nthe File menu (macOS)  > Create and then select the \nappropriate file type and follow through the steps.  \nMethod 2: Drag and drop a file from your system to the \nAcrobat Home page. \nMethod 3: Right-click on the file and then select Convert to \nAdobe PDF.",
